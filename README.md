# REST APIs for attendance and access control

This is my version of [Rodrigo Peleias](https://github.com/rpeleias/personapi_dio_live_coding/blob/master/system.properties)' REST API with Spring Boot for registering and managing people. Developed during Santander's [Bootcamp 2021](https://app.becas-santander.com/pt-BR/program/santanderbootcamp) scholarship program in partnership with [Digital Innovation One ](https://digitalinnovation.one/).
